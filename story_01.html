					<h1> "In architecture, color makes a huge impact in the design process of buildings."</h1>
					<p>Hello! I’m James Brian R. Ventura, a 23-year-old, fifth-year architecture student from Mapúa University in Intramuros, Manila. At first, I would often get teased by my grade-school classmates, because I tend to mislabel some colors that I see from objects around me. Growing up, I often interchange certain shades of green as blue, oranges as red, and purple as green. Eventually, this got me into thinking that something’s definitely wrong with my perception of certain colors. I was eventually diagnosed during a routine check-up for my student permit requirements at LTO. I underwent a diagnostic test wherein was tasked to identify the numbers that were written in different colors on several flashcards. Out of 30 items, I was only able to identify three. Having this condition really makes certain tasks a bit confusing for me on a daily basis. For instance, whenever I would sort certain articles of clothing for laundry, some colored clothes would often tend to get mixed up in the basket of white clothes. Another instance is when I’m drawing for my plates, and use medium that involves using either green, yellow, or orange, I tend to mistakenly use one of the other colors on my output. In architecture, color makes a huge impact in the design process of buildings. Being color-blind really puts me at a huge disadvantage. To counteract this, I usually rely on software such as Adobe Color for my palettes, or directly consult my peers/classmates who don’t have any difficulty in distinguishing colors.</p>
