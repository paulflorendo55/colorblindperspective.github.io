					<h1>"It doesn’t really affect my daily life because I believe I am able to see and determine colors normally most of the time."</h1>
					<p>I am Marcus Aspacio, currently a working student. I first realized that I am colorblind when I was 18 years old back in 2014 when I had to undergo an Ishihara Test and was unable to see any of the numbers on the booklet. That test was administered at a hospital as part of the physical exam for the Philippine Military Academy, but aside from that, I haven’t gone to a professional to clinically diagnose the type of colorblindness I have. It doesn’t really affect my daily life because I believe I am able to see and determine colors normally most of the time. However, there are some instances where someone has pointed out that I am wrong with a color. One of the reasons that I was surprise when I found out I am colorblind is because I took up architecture in college for 1 year and it really didn’t affect me at the time.</p>
